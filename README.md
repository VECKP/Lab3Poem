# Version Control Concepts 
*Experiencing Collaboration Problems and Designing Solutions*

## Introduction

Your professor will demonstrate how to create a private repository and add your teammates.  Make sure to add your prof also!


## Collaboration Chaos & System Design Challenge (Team of 2)

### Part A: Collaboration Chaos Simulation (15 minutes)


# Lab 3 Rubric - Version Control Concepts

**Total Points: 2 marks**

## Requirements for Completion:
* **Part A:** Complete collaboration chaos simulation with both students participating in silent editing phase and manual merge attempt
* **Part B:** Analyze problems encountered and design a version control system addressing all 6 requirements (storage, tracking, conflicts, naming, descriptions, prevention)
* **Part C:** Create clean diagram and written explanation of system design, identify top 3 problems solved
* **Wrap Up:** Answer all reflection questions demonstrating understanding of collaboration challenges

## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 mark | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Missing major components (Part A not attempted OR no system design OR no deliverable submitted) OR answers lack depth (single sentence responses, vague answers that don't address the questions) | Completed simulation and attempted system design, but design addresses only some requirements OR reflection questions show minimal understanding OR diagram/explanation lacks clarity | Successfully completed all parts: full simulation participation, comprehensive system design addressing all 6 requirements, clear diagram with explanation, and thoughtful reflection answers |

## Detailed Expectations:

### For 2 marks (Good), teams must demonstrate:
- **Active Participation:** Both students fully engaged in Part A simulation and merge attempt
- **Comprehensive System Design:** Version control solution addresses all 6 requirements:
  - Version storage strategy
  - Change tracking mechanism
  - Conflict resolution approach
  - Version naming/identification system
  - Change description method
  - Overwrite prevention solution
- **Clear Documentation:** Professional diagram and concise explanation (3-4 sentences) that clearly communicates system design
- **Problem-Solution Connection:** Identifies top 3 problems from simulation and explains how design solves them
- **Thoughtful Reflection:** Wrap-up questions answered with insight showing understanding of collaboration challenges and scalability issues

### For 1 mark (Fair), teams show:
- **Basic Participation:** Completed simulation but limited engagement in analysis
- **Incomplete Design:** System addresses some but not all requirements, or solutions are superficial
- **Adequate Documentation:** Diagram present but unclear, or explanation lacks detail
- **Weak Problem Analysis:** Problems identified but poor connection to design solutions
- **Minimal Reflection:** Wrap-up questions answered but responses show limited understanding

### For 0 marks (Poor), teams have:
- **Missing Components:** Major parts not completed or attempted
- **No System Design:** No meaningful version control solution proposed
- **No Documentation:** Missing diagram, explanation, or deliverable not submitted
- **No Demonstration of Learning:** Shows no grasp of version control concepts or collaboration challenges

## Teamwork Expectation:
Both team members must actively participate in the simulation and contribute to the system design process. The experience of collaboration problems in Part A is essential for understanding the need for version control systems.
